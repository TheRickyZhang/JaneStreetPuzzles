Some solvers for Jane Street's monthly puzzles of all sizes! I recommend checking out:

- [Hall Of Mirrors (Image Processing)](https://github.com/TheRickyZhang/JaneStreetPuzzles/tree/main/hallofmirrors)  
- [Some F Squares (Mathematical Modeling)](https://github.com/TheRickyZhang/JaneStreetPuzzles/tree/main/SomeFSquares)  
- [Altered States 2 (Reinforcement Learning)](https://github.com/TheRickyZhang/JaneStreetPuzzles/tree/main/AlteredStates2)

Most of these are run through the main function with command prompting. I wish I had the time to make proper visual interfaces!
